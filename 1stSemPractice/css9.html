      of Microsoft (along with Paul Allen). He got his start while attending
      Harvard University in 1975. He eventually dropped out on his junior year
      to pursue Microsoft as a software for the original microcomputers. Now,
      Microsoft is the largest software company in the world, making its own
      line of personal computers, email services, book publishing and video game
      systems. Gates also owns stocks in Cascade Investment LLC, where a huge
      chunk of his net worth comes from. He is also co-chair of the Bill &
      Melinda Gates Foundation with his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. ALEXANDRA
      BEIER/GETTY IMAGES With a net worth of $103.2 B, the co-chair of the Bill
      & Melinda Gates Foundation has diversified his portfolio from becoming
      predominantly Microsoft to including investments in zero-carbon energy.
      Gates also cofounded the Giving Pledge with ex-wife Melinda and friend
      Warren Buffett, and his philanthropic efforts had a hand in the decrease
      in his net worth at the end of 2022. According to Forbes, he donated $20 B
